## Questions for Christos Bacharakis
There may not be enough time for Christos to answer a question from everyone, so this table will be
used to prioritize the questions.
Put the question you would like to ask Christos in the left-hand column, and put a 1 in the right hand column.
Read the other questions. If you vote in favor of a question that is already in the table, then increment its count.
**Do not decrement any counts!**

I started the table with a question as an example.
